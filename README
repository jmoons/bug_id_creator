This script will generate a collection of unique identifiers in sequence consisting by default of 3 characters, but does support more characters.

The unique identifier sequence starts at 000, 001, ... , 009, 00A, 00B, ... , 00Z, 010, 011, .. , 0ZZ, 100, 101, ... , ZZY, ZZZ.

The class is instantiated with a hash of three possible arguments:
  last_generated_value - a string representation of the last value generated
  number_of_characters - an integer specifying the number of characters from which to create a sequence. Defaults to 3.
  number_of_values_to_generate - an integer specifying how many values to generate in the sequence. Defaults to 0.

If last_generated_value is specified, arguments for number_of_characters and number_of_values_to_generate are ignored.

Note, there is no data validation or sanitization of initialization arguments supplied to script.

The collection of generated values is accessible as the read-only instance variable generated_value_collection

The public method print_collection prints, newline delimited, each value of the sequence
