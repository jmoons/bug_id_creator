This script will generate a unique identifier consisting by default of 3 characters, but does support more characters.

The unique identifier sequence starts at 000, 001, ... , 009, 00A, 00B, ... , 00Z, 010, 011, .. , 0ZZ, 100, 101, etc.

The class is instantiated with two arguments:

last_generated_value: either nil or a string representation of the last value generated
  If nil - the script will begin its value generation with 000
  If not nil - the script will begin its value generation with the next identifier in the sequence

number_of_values_to_generate: a integer specifying how many values to generate

Note, there is no data validation or sanitization of initialization arguments supplied to script.
